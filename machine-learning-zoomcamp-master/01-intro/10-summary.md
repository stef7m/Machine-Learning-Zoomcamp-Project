### 📚 Summary of First Session - Machine Learning Zoomcamp

1. **🚗 Introduction to Machine Learning with Cars Data**  
   We start with data about cars, including characteristics (features) and prices (target). A Machine Learning (ML) model can be used to extract patterns from known information (data) about some cars in order to predict car prices based on their characteristics.

2. **🧠 Rules-Based Systems vs. Machine Learning**  
   - **Rules-Based Systems:** It is necessary to manually convert rules into code using a programming language and apply them to data. Extracting patterns manually can become complex and challenging.  
   - **Machine Learning:** Instead of manually coding rules, ML models automatically extract patterns from data using Mathematics and Statistics.

3. **🔍 Supervised Machine Learning**  
   In supervised learning, models learn from labeled data (with known outcomes) to make predictions on unseen data.

4. **🛠️ CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)**  
   A structured methodology for organizing ML projects, consisting of the following steps:  
   - 💼 **Business Understanding**  
   - 🔎 **Data Understanding**  
   - 🧹 **Data Preparation**  
   - 🤖 **Modeling** (choosing and training models, then selecting the best one)  
   - 📊 **Evaluation**  
   - 🚀 **Deployment**  
   This process is iterative, allowing for continuous improvement.

5. **🏆 Model Selection**  
   Split data into training, validation, and test sets. Train different models, validate them, select the best performing one, and then test it on the test set to ensure generalization.

6. **💻 Setting Up the Environment**  
   Install necessary tools like Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn. Anaconda is the easiest option. Eventually create an AWS account for cloud resources.

7. **🔢 Introduction to Numpy**  
   Numpy is crucial for manipulating numerical data, providing efficient operations on arrays and matrices.

8. **🔗 Linear Algebra**  
   Covering all types of multiplication with vectors and matrices, including the creation of identity matrices using functions like `np.eye()`.

9. **📊 Introduction to Pandas**  
   Pandas is a Python library used for processing and analyzing tabular data efficiently.
